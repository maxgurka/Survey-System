# Survey-System
ASP.NET (MVC) solution for the creation and distribution of online surveys.

- Create surveys with multiple-choice and/or free-text questions
- Copy existing surveys to use them as templates
- View charts with response statisctics
- Add survey recipents manually or by loading a *.csv* or *.xlsx* files
- Create email lists with recipients
- Mass send emails with personalized survey links
## Setup
Feel free to use whatever editors/IDEs.
However we strongly recommend *Visual Studio*.

 1. Download and install *Visual Studio Community Edition* - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/
 2. Make sure to install the following workloads (during installation or after using *Visual Studio Installer*) 
	  - *ASP.NET and web development*
	  - *Data storage and processing*
 3. After loading the solution open the *Package Manager Console* and run the command `Update-Database`

You should now have a working project that can be debugged by hitting F5.
